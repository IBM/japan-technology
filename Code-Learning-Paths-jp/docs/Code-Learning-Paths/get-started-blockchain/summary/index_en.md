## Summary

In this learning path, you learned the fundamental concepts behind blockchainâ€™s distributed ledger technology, including how blockchain networks work. You were introduced to key blockchain terminology, and you got an overview of how to use Hyperledger Fabric. In addition, you learned how to create a blockchain network based on Hyperledger Fabric or by building it manually. Finally, you walked through the steps for setting up a basic blockchain network with the IBM Blockchain Platform.

## Next steps

Continue your learning and building your blockchain skills:

* [Create a basic blockchain network using the blockchain platform](/patterns/build-a-blockchain-network/)
* [Create and execute a blockchain smart contract](/patterns/create-and-execute-a-blockchain-smart-contract-ibp-v20/)
* [Emit events from the blockchain platform](/patterns/implementing-blockchain-events-using-ibp-vscode-extension)
