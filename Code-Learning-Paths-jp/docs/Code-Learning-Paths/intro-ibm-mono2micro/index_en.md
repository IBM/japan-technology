[IBM Mono2Micro](http://ibm.biz/Mono2Micro), offered by WebSphere Hybrid Edition, uses the power of AI to refactor monolitic Java applications into microservices. The added power of machine learning and AI makes the refactoring process a semi-automated one, so that you don't have to rewrite your entire application code in order to create a microservice architecture.

In this learning path, learn about the key features of IBM Mono2Micro and how to use them to transform monolithic Java applications into microservices.

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Understand what the key features of IBM Mono2Micro are and how to use them
* Understand the advantages of using IBM Mono2Micro to automate application refactoring
* Discover the approaches for breaking up monolithic applications into microservices
* Learn how to use IBM Mono2Micro to break up a monolithic application into microservices before deploying those microservices into containers
