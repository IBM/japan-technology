## Summary

This learning path is designed for anyone interested in quickly getting up to speed with IBM Streams â€” an advanced analytics platform that allows you to develop applications that analyze data in real time. This learning path consists of articles and step-by-step tutorials, and code patterns that explain the process of detecting patterns and trends as they occur. The learning path covered:

* Key advantages of using IBM Streams
* Building and demonstrating a streaming app
* Creating a streaming app powered by Apache Kafka
* Building a streaming app using a Python API
* Accessing streaming data with REST services
* Scoring streaming data with a machine learning model

## Next steps

Continue your learning and building your IBM Streams skills with more how-to articles, tutorials, videos, and code patterns in the [IBM Developer Analytics](/technologies/analytics) hub.
