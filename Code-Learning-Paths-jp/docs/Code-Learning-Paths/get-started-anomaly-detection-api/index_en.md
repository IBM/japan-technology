## Overview

This learning path provides an overview of anomaly detection for time series data and demonstrates the use of the [Anomaly Detection APIs](https://developer.ibm.com/apis/catalog/ai4industry--anomaly-detection-product/api/API--ai4industry--anomaly-detection-api/#connection_check) to support Industry 4.0 use cases. Included in this learning path is a step-by-step instruction to get started with using the APIs along with reference to easy-to-use Jupyter Notebooks that apply the API on univariate and multivariate time series data.

### Skill level
