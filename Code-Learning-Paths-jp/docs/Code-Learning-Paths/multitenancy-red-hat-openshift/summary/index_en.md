The resources in this learning path taught you about multitenancy in Red Hat OpenShift. Specifically, you learned what multitenancy is, why it's beneficial in an OpenShift environment, and different ways to achieve multitenancy in OpenShift. 

You also walked through tutorials that helped you implement multitenancy using the following methods:

- Setting up role-based access control (RBAC) in OpenShift projects
- Isolating network for tenants
- Isolating resources for tenants
