## What are containers?

A container is a unit of deployable software that provides isolation at the process level. Each application, together with its environment, can run in an isolated environment. Containers expose a different environment to each of the services. You can automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

In the following video, developer advocates Nicholas Bourdakos and Mofizur Rahman briefly describe what containers are and how they work.
