## Overview

The Internet of Things is more than a technological trend, it is a technological revolution. By embedding sensors in everyday things, connecting them, and applying analytics to the data they collect, the objects around us become smarter.  To be a part of this technological revolution, youâ€™ll need to explore the architectures, designs, and development best practices of more complex IoT solutions.

### Prerequisite knowledge

Before completing this learning path, you should complete the [Getting started with IoT development](/learningpaths/iot-getting-started-iot-development/) learning path.

### Skill level

Intermediate.

### Estimated time to complete

Approximately 5 hours

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Understand how to apply standard IoT architectures for your IoT project
* Avoid some of the worst security issues in IoT solutions
* Know how you can best manage your IoT devices
* Store your IoT data, analyze that IoT data, and apply rules to act on your IoT data
* Understand how to get started with large-scale IoT projects
* Develop an IoT device and IoT application that uses an Python, MQTT and UDP, and IBM Watson IoT Platform.
