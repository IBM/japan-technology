## Summary

In this learning path, you got an introduction to deep learning. This learning path covered:

* Deep learning concepts
* Deep learning architectures
* A comparison of deep learning frameworks
* Enabling Eager Execution in TensorFlow
* Performing linear regression using TensorFlow
* Creating a Jupyter Notebook that contains Python code for defining logistic regression, then using TensorFlow to implement it
* An understanding of how to build neural networks without the help of the frameworks

## Next steps

Continue your learning and building your deep learning skills with more how-to tutorials and articles on the [IBM Developer machine learning](/technologies/deep-learning/) hub.
