## Overview

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools help in automating the end-to-end process that is involved in building and maintaining machine learning models. In this learning path, learn how AutoAI in Watson Studio can automatically prepare data, apply machine learning algorithms, perform hyperparameter optimization, and build model pipelines best suited for your data sets and use cases.
