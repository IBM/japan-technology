## Summary

In this learning path, you learned how AutoAI in Watson Studio can automatically prepare data, apply machine learning algorithms, perform hyperparameter optimization, and build model pipelines best suited for your data sets and use cases. The learning path covered:

* An overview of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)
* An introduction to AutoAI
* A comparison of model building with and without AutoAI
* How to generate the optimal model pipeline for your problem
* How to auto-generate a Python notebook using AutoAI
* How to quickly create your Python machine learning web app
* Information about automated feature engineering for relational data
