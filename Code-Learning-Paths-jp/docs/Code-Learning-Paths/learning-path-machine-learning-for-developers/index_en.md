## Overview

This learning path is designed for anyone interested in quickly getting up to speed with machine learning. The learning path consists of step-by-step tutorials with hands-on demonstrations where you will build models and use them in apps. You'll use Python and scikit-learn to build and test the models.

### Skill level

Beginner

### Estimated time to complete

Approximately 2 hours.

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Understand what machine learning is
* Understand supervised versus unsupervised learning
* Perform data exploration and preprocessing
* Prepare and train a classification model
* Understand linear regression
* Know the basics of solving a classification-based machine learning problem
* Understand and use clustering algorithms using Python and scikit-learn
