### Build a movie recommendation system using deep learning

In this [video](/components/watson-ml-accelerator/videos/build-a-movie-recommendation-system-using-deep-learning/), learn how to use the IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator API to accelerate the training of a movie recommendation model using a graphics processing unit (GPU). There’s also an accompanying article. Watson Machine Learning Accelerator is available as a part of the IBM Watson Studio family of AI tools on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. It is a GPU-accelerated deep learning service that lets you share GPU resources across business units to deliver faster training results.


### Build a TensorFlow model using Deep Learning Experiment Builder

Learn how to [build a TensorFlow model using the MNIST data set for deep learning with Watson Machine Learning Accelerator](/components/watson-ml-accelerator/videos/build-a-tensorflow-model-using-deep-learning-experiment-builder/), which is available as a part of the IBM Watson Studio family of AI tools on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. It is a GPU-accelerated deep learning service that lets you share GPU resources across business units to deliver faster training results.

### Overview of Watson Machine Learning Accelerator

Get an [overview of IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator](/components/watson-ml-accelerator/videos/overview-of-watson-machine-learning-accelerator/), a complete AI data science platform for enterprises. Watson Machine Learning Accelerator is available as a part of the IBM Watson Studio family of AI tools on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. It is a GPU-accelerated deep learning service that lets you share GPU resources across business units to deliver faster training results.

### Automate hyperparameter optimization training with the Watson Machine Learning Accelerator API

[Submit a model and data set to the Watson Machine Learning Accelerator API](/components/watson-ml-accelerator/videos/automate-hyperparameter-optimization-training-with-the-wml-accelerator-api/) to run hyperparameter optimization, or HPO. You use the Pytorch MNIST HPO as the training model, inject hyperparameters for the sub-training during search, submit a tuning metric for better results, then query for the best job results.

### Introduction to Watson Machine Learning Accelerator for Cloud Pak for Data

Learn about this [GPU-accelerated deep learning service](https://developer.ibm.com/components/watson-ml-accelerator/videos/introduction-to-watson-machine-learning-accelerator-for-cloud-pak-for-data/) that lets you share GPU resources across business units to deliver faster training results.

### Balance deep learning jobs with Elastic Distributed Training

See how you can [use elastic distributed training to balance IBM Watson® Machine Learning Accelerator jobs](/components/watson-ml-accelerator/videos/balance-deep-learning-jobs-with-elastic-distributed-training/) in IBM Cloud Pak® for Data. Using Watson Machine Learning Accelerator, GPUs are dynamically allocated to data scientists currently running workloads.

### Deliver faster deep learning results on GPUs

Watch how a [deep learning workload is run on a CPU](/components/watson-ml-accelerator/videos/deliver-faster-deep-learning-results-on-gpus/), then see how much faster the same deep learning workload runs on a GPU. Using a Cloud Pak for Data 3.5 notebook, you can see that deep learning training is 10 times faster on GPUs.
