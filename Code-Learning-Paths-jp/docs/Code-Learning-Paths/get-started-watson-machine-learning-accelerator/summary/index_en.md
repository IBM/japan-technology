## Summary

In this learning path, you got an overview of IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator. It included articles and videos that explain what Watson Machine Learning Accelerator is as well as its various features, and notebooks to help you work with it and get hands-on experience. The learning path covered: 

* An introduction to Watson Machine Learning Accelerator and how to use it
* An overview of Elastic Distributed Training in Watson Machine Learning Accelerator
* Videos that range from expert tech talks, live streams, and replays of live tech talks or events that show developers using or discussing Watson Machine Learning Accelerator

## Next steps

Explore a [case study that shows how IBM Cloud Pak for Data with IBM Watson Machine Learning Accelerator helps the client toward the goal of being a data-driven organization](/articles/master-class-on-siloed-data-with-inconsistent-tools-and-skill-levels/). Learn how they leveraged an integrated data and AI platform to enable multiple business units, democratizing data science in the process. Now they are able to manage and analyze departmental and high-capacity (billions of rows) data with a single platform.
