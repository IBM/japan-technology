## Summary

IBM MQ is a robust, reliable, and secure messaging solution. It simplifies and accelerates the integration of different applications across multiple platforms, and it supports a wide range of APIs and languages. IBM MQ allows the server infrastructure to span data center, mainframe, and cloud frameworks. MQ enables applications to communicate and exchange data in a reliable and scalable way, that decouples one application from another.

In this learning path, you learned the core IBM MQ messaging concepts, created and configured a queue manager, queue, and topic, and developed and debugged a simple point-to-point JMS application that interacts with the queue manager.
