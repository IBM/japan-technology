## Overview
Many articles and blogs about the Internet of Things, or IoT, start with their own definition of IoT and then spew stats and metrics about how IoT is growing at exponential rates. (You probably already know what is meant by IoT, but if you'd still like an introduction, watch this [IBM Think Academy How It Works video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSIPNhOiMoE).)

### Skill level

Beginner

### Estimated time to complete

Approximately 2 hours.

## Learning objectives

Upon completion of this learning path, you will be able to:

* Understand the skills you need to be a successful IoT developer
* Determine which hardware to use in your IoT project
* Choose the right networking technology for your IoT project
* Understand the benefits of using an IoT platform
* Complete your first IoT project, a smart doorbell by using a Raspberry Pi, some sensors, a buzzer, Node-RED, and Apple Home Kit
