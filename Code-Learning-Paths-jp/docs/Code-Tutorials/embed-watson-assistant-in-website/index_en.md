Watson Assistant can help you solve a problem by providing an intelligent interface using natural language. The flexibilities of the GUI tools and APIs combine to allow you to power applications and tools using AI simply and efficiently. After your assistant is published, you can easily embed it into a web page.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need a published instance of [Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant?cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-cloudreg). If you are following the [Watson Assistant learning path](/learningpaths/get-started-watson-assistant) then you will already have this, but you can use any Assistant chatbot.

Additionally, you need a web page to embed the chatbot in. If you don't already have one, you can use this [index.html](static/index.html) file as a template (use the [styles.css](static/styles.css) if you want).

## Steps

### Step 1. Explore the Web chat features

1. Click  the **Connect** icon, and under Channels click **Web chat**.

The Live agent tab lets you set up a service desk connection so that your assistant can transfer customers to live agents. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat#deploy-web-chat-haa&cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-cloudreg) about this feature.

The Suggestions tab provides suggestions that appear as message options when your customers need some help. They adapt to the conversation and can offer both responses to try and connections to support. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat#deploy-web-chat-alternate&cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-cloudreg). You won't use Suggestions in this tutorial, so click the **On** check mark to turn it off.

### Step 2. Get the code to embed your chatbot
