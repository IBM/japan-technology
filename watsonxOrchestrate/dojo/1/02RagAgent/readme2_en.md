# watsonx Orchestrate AI Agent Experience ‚Äì Part 2

_Last updated: October 30, 2025_

In this exercise, you will extend your AI agent **IBMInfo** (created in Part 1) by adding knowledge using the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** approach. Please ensure that you have completed [Part 1](https://github.com/IBM/japan-technology/blob/main/watsonxOrchestrate/dojo/1/01HelloAgent/readme1_en.md) before starting.

* Adding Knowledge

### 7. The *Knowledge source* section will show **Processing...** as the file is being indexed. The system uses the uploaded PDF and description to prepare searchable knowledge for your agent. This may take around two minutes.

<img width="377" height="400" alt="2-7-Processing" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0989ead6-2017-4581-ad0f-24bf79bef107" />

### 8. When processing is complete, the *Knowledge source* will display **Connected**, and you‚Äôll see the file name `2024-annual-report.pdf` and your description:  
‚ÄúThis is IBM‚Äôs 2024 Annual Report, including financial information and core business strategy.‚Äù

<img width="1181" height="974" alt="2-8-Connected" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5690c741-ae4c-427e-b534-9538e5a41c51" />


### 9. Use the **Preview** window to ask a question based on the uploaded document.  
* **Input:** 
```
What was IBM‚Äôs free cash flow in 2024?
```

The AI agent will reply with **$12.7 billion**.

<img width="1181" height="974" alt="2-10-FreeCashFlowResult" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a20654a-955a-43d8-a904-93798cf7f213" />

### 10. Open *2024-annual-report.pdf* and check page 3 (document page 1). You‚Äôll find the following text:

```
2024 Performance
For the year, IBM generated $62.8 billion in revenue, up 3%
at constant currency, and $12.7 billion in free cash flow ‚Äî an
increase of $1.5 billion year-over-year.
```

### 11. Click **Show Reasoning v** to the right of the agent‚Äôs answer timestamp.

You‚Äôll see ‚ÄúTool: knowledge_for_agent_IBMInfo,‚Äù confirming that the agent used the uploaded knowledge to answer your question.

### 12. Ask another question:  
* **Input:** 
```
How much did free cash flow change year-over-year in 2024? Please include the unit and provide the amount.
```  
The answer should reflect the same context found in the report above.

### 13. Ask about a different section of the document:  
* **Input:** 
```
What was Revenue in 2024?
```

```
What was Net income in 2024?
```

```
What was Net income in 2023?
```

## Optional Exercise ‚Äì Trace the Agent‚Äôs Workflow

You can trace the behavior of your **IBMInfo** agent using **LangGraph**, a workflow framework for LLM-based applications.
