                car or farm-fresh peaches) or intangible (such as a mortgage or patent). A
                        <em><strong>transaction</strong></em> is an asset transfer onto or
                off of the ledger. In a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, assets are
                represented as a collection of key-value pairs (for example,
                vehicleOwner=Daisy) in binary or JSON form, or
                both.<!-- 
                Changes to assets are recorded as

                a private "subnet" of communication between two or more specific network
                members, for the purpose of conducting private and confidential
                transactions.
                <!--Each transaction on the network is executed on a channel,

                If two participants form a channel, then those participants <mdash/> and

                that channel and share copies of the ledger for that channel. Thanks to
                channels, the network members who need private and confidential

                members of a blockchain business network use to agree that a transaction
                is valid and to keep the ledger consistently synchronized. Consensus
                mechanisms lower the risk of fraudulent transactions, because tampering
                with transactions added to the ledger would have to occur across many
                places at the same time.</p><p>To reach consensus, participants agree to the transaction and validate it
                before it is permanently recorded in the ledger. Participants can also
                establish rules to verify transactions. No one, not even a system
                administrator, can delete a transaction that has been added to the ledger.
                A trusted network of participants reduces the costs of establishing
                consensus, relative to the higher costs present in permissionless
                blockchains. </p><p>In a business blockchain, a wide variety of consensus mechanisms are
                available to choose from. Where trust is high, a simple majority voting
                may suffice, or the network may choose to use a more sophisticated
                method.</p><!--<heading stepnum="6" type="h2">Cryptographic hashes and digital

            <p><em><strong>Cryptographic hashes</strong></em>, such as the SHA256
                computational algorithm, produce a fixed-size, unique hash value, known as
                a digest, from variable-sized transaction input. Hashes feature a
                mathematical property in which a hash can be arrived at uniquely from a
                given input, but the input cannot be derived from its hash value. A given
                specific input always results in the same hash value being computed.</p>

            <p>Any modifications or alterations to transaction input <mdash/> even the
                most minuscule change <mdash/> results in a different hash value being
                computed, which indicates potentially compromised transaction input. Thus,
                the hash value can be used to detect the integrity of the transaction
                input.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Digital signatures</strong></em> ensure that the receiver
                receives the transactions without intermediate parties modifying or
                forging the contents of transactions, while also ensuring that the
                transactions originated from senders (signed with private keys) and not
                imposters.</p>

            <p>Symmetric key encryption makes use of one private key that is used to
                encrypt and decrypt data. That key must be shared using a secure network,
                while data can be broadcast on an insecure network, and read only by
                parties that have the private key:</p>

                        cryptography</strong></em>, also known as <em><strong>asymmetric

                participant has a public/private key pair. A sender can encrypt data using
                the receiver's public key. The document or data can then be read only by
