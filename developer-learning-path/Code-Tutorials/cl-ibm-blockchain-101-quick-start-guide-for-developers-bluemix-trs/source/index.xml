                        target="new"><strong>Glossary</strong></a> of blockchain and
                    Hyperledger Fabric terminology.</p>
            </sidebar>--><p>A <strong><em>business blockchain network</em></strong> is a decentralized
                network that uses distributed ledger technology for the efficient and
                secure transfer of business assets between member organizations in the
                network. Assets can be physical or digital, such as vehicles, diamonds,
                fresh produce, or insurance records. A shared, <strong><em>distributed
                        ledger</em></strong> records an immutable history of all asset
                transactions between participants in the network, and catalogs the current
                state (world state) of those assets. The business rules that govern
                transactions
                <!--(who can order a car from whom, how much it costs, where it
                will be manufactured, for example)-->
                are agreed upon by members and encapsulated in
                    <strong><em>chaincode</em></strong>, also known as smart
                contracts.</p><p>Instead of relying on a central authority or trusted intermediary, such as
                a bank or brokerage firm, to validate transactions, members of a
                blockchain network use a <strong><em>consensus</em></strong> mechanism to
                improve transaction processing speed, transparency, and accountability
                across the network. For additional confidentiality, members join one or
                more <strong><em>channels</em></strong> that allow for data isolation; a
                channel-specific ledger is shared by the authenticated peers in that
                channel.</p><p>A blockchain network for business is collectively owned and operated by a
                group of identifiable and verifiable institutions, such as businesses,
                universities, or hospitals<!--, or government organizations-->. In such a
                        <strong><em>permissioned network</em></strong>, the participants
                are known to each other, and transactions are processed much faster than
                in an non-permissioned, public network, like the Bitcoin network. In the
                Bitcoin network, members are anonymous, forcing the reliance on
                "proof-of-work" and other types of consensus mechanisms that require
                time-consuming computations to confirm identities and validate
                transactions.</p><p>Need more background?</p><ul><li>Check out our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-blockchain-basics-intro-bluemix-trs/" target="new"><strong>Introduction to distributed

                    kick-starter network</strong> consisting of an <em>ordering
                    service</em> to sequence transactions for the shared ledger, a default
                    <em>channel</em> for communication between the member companies, and
                    <em>two companies</em>, each with a <em>certificate authority</em> and
                    <em>peer node</em> to validate and commit transactions to the ledger.
                The Starter Plan integrates all Hyperledger Fabric capabilities and the
                Hyperledger Composer development toolset (called <em>IBM Blockchain
                    Platform: Develop</em>), with the added benefit of an intuitive UI
                that cuts network administration and governance time.</p><p>With the Starter Plan, you can:</p><ul><li>Immediately deploy and demo sample applications (via IBM Cloud
                    toolchains for continuous delivery), and see asset transfers in
                    action.</li><li>Iteratively develop and test your own applications and chaincode in a
                    pre-production staging environment.</li><li>Interact with your network by using APIs in the Swagger UI. Network
                    credentials are provided so you can integrate the APIs into your own
                    applications.</li><li>Invite other organizations to join your network and set up their own
                    peers.</li><li>Add other member organizations to your IBM Cloud account to simulate
                    multi-organization transaction scenarios.

                    practice collaborative tasks like adding channels and chaincode--></li><!--<li>Create chaincode (business logic) that you can easily migrate to an
                    Enterprise plan</li>--><li>Develop valuable network governance and operation skills that you can
                    seamlessly transfer to an Enterprise plan. The Starter Plan offers the
                    same experience as the Enterprise plans, so there's no learning curve
                    when migrating to your full production network.</li></ul><!--000 not sure this is needed or true; dup? move down?--><!--<p>Once your kick-starter network is spun up, you can model your own network
                define your participants, assets, and
                transactions in an easy-to-use modelling language. From that model (called
                a <em>business network archive</em>, or .bna file), all the code you need
                to import and deploy your model is generated, including GoLang or
                JavaScript chaincode to encode the business logic, and a REST-based API
                for application development.</p>--><p>You can use the Starter Plan's <strong>sample applications</strong> for
                demo purposes and for developing your own applications. To automatically
                deploy and run a sample application, just select, deploy, and launch it
                via the IBM Cloud toolchain. Or learn how to develop your own
                applications, step by step, by deploying and customizing the sample
                applications manually.</p><!--help you collaborate 
                with your business owner to create chaincode
                and blockchain applications to solve business problems.--><p>Several sample applications are available for you to experiment with and
                run in the default channel. For example:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Marbles sample</strong> is a colorful demonstration of how
                    a front-end application interacts with chaincode, as members on a
                    network transfer virtual marbles to other members. The application is
                    written in Node.js, and the chaincode is written in Go.</li><li>The <strong>Vehicle Manufacture sample</strong> is both an Angular web
                    application and a tutorial that steps you through using Hyperledger
                    Composer to model a simple network that tracks a new car from order to
                    delivery.</li><li>The <strong>Perishable Goods sample</strong> tracks a shipment in a
                    supply chain, stores sensor data on the blockchain, and demonstrates
                    the use of a smart legal contract.</li><!--<li>The <strong>Fabcar sample</strong> shows you how to perform queries and ledger
                    updates on car records in the ledger. Fabcar is written in Node.js,
                    and the chaincode is written in Go.</li>--></ul><!--<li>Generate a complete sample application from your .bna file. You can
                    easily create a sample web application from your .bna file by running
                    the <a target="new"

                    generated Angular app interfaces with a REST server, which you can
                    either point to or create when running the demo. You can then demo the
                    app as is, or customize it for your use case.</li>--><p>The Starter Plan's <strong>intuitive UI</strong> helps you govern and
                monitor your network. For example, you can view your peer nodes, add
                organizations to your network, create new channels for data isolation and
                privacy for a subset of members, install chaincode on a peer and
                instantiate it on a channel, and set up notifications for activities that
                need member approval.</p><!--<p>Take a look:</p>--><heading type="h2">Starter Plan demo (video)</heading><p>In this video, Don and Mark walk you through how to launch your Starter

                <!--is an entry-level option that enables organizations
                to simulate multi-organization blockchain networks, quickly develop
                applications, and work with supplied examples. It also boasts the same UI
                experience as other membership options, helping to eliminate any learning
                curve. See below for more information and uses of Starter Plan.-->
                makes it easier than ever to get hands-on experience with business
                blockchain development, governance, and operation in a collaborative,
                pre-production environment. And because the same easy-to-use UI extends
                through the other membership plans, your learning curve is flattened when
                you move to production deployment.</p><heading type="h2">What's NOT in the Starter Plan</heading><p>The Starter Plan is optimized for getting started with pre-production
                development and testing. It differs from the Enterprise plans in several
                ways:</p><ul><li>In the Starter Plan, the certificate authority and ordering service
                    are not fault tolerant. Each company in the Starter Plan network has
                    only one certificate authority, and the network has only one ordering
                    service, which performs SOLO consensus.</li><li>In the Starter Plan, the Hardware Security Module (HSM) is not
                    available to safeguard and manage digital keys for strong
                    authentication and cryptoprocessing.</li><li>In the Starter Plan, during maintenance and network updates (performed
                    weekly on Tuesday mornings), you may experience brief outages.</li><li>The Starter Plan does not guarantee data retention with release
                    upgrades.
                    <!--Migrating your data from a Starter Plan network to
                    Enterprise plans is not currently supported.-->
                    However, you <em>can migrate</em> your Starter Plan .bna files,
                    chaincode, and applications to Enterprise plans.</li></ul><heading type="h2">What's beyond the Starter Plan</heading><p>When you're ready to grow your network further and deploy your network
                definition, chaincode, and applications to a production environment with
                added layers of hardened security and premium support, you'll want an
                Enterprise plan.</p><p>In an Enterprise plan, you get all of the Starter Plan features, plus a
                crash-tolerant, production-level infrastructure running in a secure cloud
                container on an IBM z<reg/> mainframe, complete with runtime/data
                isolation, high availability for the ordering service and certificate
                authority, and the ability to use HSM cards for secure key storage.</p><!--000 IBM Z or LinuxONE<trade/>?--><heading alttoc="The Starter Plan vs. open source CLI" type="h2">Why not just
                use open source technologies directly on your own computer?</heading><p>A locally deployed blockchain based on the Hyperledger Fabric framework and
                built with Hyperledger Composer tools will be a terrific simulation. But
                without access to other member organizations, you can't experience or test
                the scalability and power of a multi-organization network. Furthermore,
                using the open source technologies locally requires a bit more patience
                and dexterity with command-line coding.</p><p>Conversely, with the Starter Plan, you get a scalable, reliable, fully
                integrated IDE that guides you through network creation, deployment,
                monitoring, and governance with simple clicks, easy instructions, and
                extensible samples. The code and skills you develop on the Starter Plan
                are easily transferable to Enterprise plans, when you're ready for a
