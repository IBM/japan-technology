                First, a little background is in order.</p><heading refname="" type="h2">What is a distributed ledger?</heading><p> A <strong><em>distributed ledger</em></strong> is a type of database that
                is shared, replicated, and synchronized among the members of a
                decentralized network.
                The distributed ledger records the transactions, such as the exchange of
                assets or data, among the participants in the network.</p><p> Participants in the network govern and agree by consensus on the updates
                to the records in the ledger. No central authority or third-party mediator, such as a
                financial institution or clearinghouse, is involved. Every record in the distributed ledger 
                has a timestamp and unique
                cryptographic signature, thus making the ledger an auditable, immutable
                history of all transactions in the network.
                <!--One implementation of distributed ledger
                technology is the open source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.--></p><heading refname="" type="h3">The role of business ledgers</heading><p>In today's connected and integrated world, economic
                activity<!--, wealth and
                value creation--> takes place in
                business networks that span <!--across--> national, geographic, and
                jurisdictional boundaries. Business networks typically come together at
                marketplaces where the <em><strong>participants</strong></em>, such as
                producers, consumers, suppliers, partners, market makers/enablers, and
                other stakeholders own, control, and exercise their rights, privileges,
                and entitlements on objects of value known as
                    <em><strong>assets</strong></em>.</p><p>Assets can be tangible and physical, such as cars, homes, or strawberries,
                or intangible and virtual, such as deeds, patents, and stock certificates.
                Asset ownership and transfers are the
                    <em><strong>transactions</strong></em> that create value in a business
                network.</p><p>Transactions typically involve various participants like buyers, sellers,
                and intermediaries (such as banks, auditors, or notaries) whose business
                agreements and contracts <!--within a business context and--> are recorded
                in <em><strong>ledgers</strong></em>. A business typically uses multiple
                ledgers to keep track of asset ownership and asset transfers between
                participants in its various lines of businesses. Ledgers are the systems
                of record for a business's economic activities and interests.</p><p>A typical ledger looks something like this:</p><figure><img alt="" height="190" src="ledger.png" width="639"/></figure><heading refname="" type="h3">Problems with current business ledgers</heading><p>Current business ledgers in use today are deficient in many ways. They are
                inefficient, costly, and <!--slow,--> subject to misuse and tampering.
                <!--These problems stem from reliance on centralized third-party <!-\-actors-\->
                systems, such as financial institutions, clearinghouses, and other
                mediators of existing institutional arrangements.</p>
            <p>These centralized ledger systems lead to bottlenecks and slowdowns of
                transaction settlements. --> Lack of transparency, as well as susceptibility
                to corruption and fraud, lead to disputes. Having to resolve disputes and
                possibly reverse transactions or provide insurance for transactions is
                costly. These risks and uncertainties contribute to missed business
                opportunities.</p><p>Furthermore, out-of-sync copies of business ledgers on each network
                participantâ€™s own systems lead to faulty business decisions made on
                temporary, incorrect data. At best, the ability to make a fully informed
                decision is delayed while differing copies of the ledgers are
                reconciled.</p><!--<pullquote>

                transactions in a public or private peer-to-peer network. Distributed to
                all member nodes in the network, the ledger permanently records, in a
                sequential chain of cryptographic hash-linked
                    <em><strong>blocks</strong></em>, the history of asset exchanges that
                take place between the peers in the network.</p><p>All the confirmed and validated transaction blocks are linked and chained
                from the beginning of the chain to the most current block, hence the name
                        <em><strong>blockchain</strong></em>. The blockchain thus acts as
                a single source of truth, and members in a blockchain network can view
                only those transactions that are relevant to them.</p><heading refname="" type="h2">How does a blockchain network work?</heading><sidebar><heading>Test your blockchain knowledge!</heading><p>Take the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/courses/all/blockchain-essentials/">Blockchain essentials course for developers</a>, and you'll learn

                mediate transactions, member nodes in a blockchain network
                <!--payment system--> use a consensus protocol to agree on ledger content,
                and cryptographic hashes and digital signatures to ensure the integrity of
                transactions.</p><p><em><strong>Consensus</strong></em> ensures that the shared ledgers are
                exact copies, and lowers the risk of fraudulent transactions, because
                tampering would have to occur across many places at exactly the same time.
                        <strong><em>Cryptographic hashes</em></strong>, such as the SHA256
                computational algorithm, ensure that any alteration to transaction input
                <mdash/> even the most minuscule change <mdash/> results in a different
                hash value being computed, which indicates potentially compromised
                transaction input. <strong><em>Digital signatures</em></strong> ensure
                that transactions originated from senders (signed with private keys) and
                not imposters.</p><p>The decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain network prevents any single
                participant or group of participants from controlling the underlying
                infrastructure or undermining the entire system. Participants in the
                network are all equal, adhering to the same protocols. They can be
                individuals, state actors, organizations, or a combination of all these
                types of participants.</p><p>At its core, the system records the chronological order of transactions
                with all nodes agreeing to the validity of transactions using the chosen
                consensus model. The result is transactions that cannot be altered or
                reversed, unless the change is agreed to by all members in the network in
                a subsequent transaction.</p><button-link><text>Kick-start your own blockchain network now with the new IBM

            </sidebar>--><p>In legacy business networks, all participants maintain their own ledgers
                with duplication and discrepancies that result in disputes, increased
                settlement times, and the need for intermediaries with their associated
                overhead costs. However, by using blockchain-based shared ledgers, where
                transactions cannot be altered once validated by consensus and written to
                the ledger, businesses can <strong><em>save time and costs while reducing
                        risks</em></strong>. </p><p>Blockchain consensus mechanisms provide the benefits of a consolidated,
                consistent dataset with reduced errors, near-real-time reference data, and
                the flexibility for participants to change the descriptions of the assets
                they own.</p><p>Because no one participating member owns the source of origin for
                information contained in the shared ledger, blockchain technologies lead
                to increased trust and integrity in the flow of transaction information
                among the participating members.</p><p>Immutability mechanisms of blockchain technologies lead to lowered cost of
                audit and regulatory compliance with improved transparency. And because
                contracts being executed on business networks using blockchain
                technologies are automated and final, businesses benefit from increased
                speed of execution, reduced costs, and less risk, all of which enables
                businesses to <strong><em>build new revenue streams to interact with
                        clients</em></strong>.</p><heading type="h2">What's a good blockchain use case?</heading><sidebar><heading>Is blockchain is right for you?</heading><!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKb3D66Akv4--><video-container><video-id>RKb3D66Akv4</video-id><video-title display="no">What makes a good blockchain

                <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/05/the-difference-between-bitcoin-and-blockchain-for-business/">technology
                underpinning Bitcoin exchanges</a>, but its practical uses in the world of
                business extend far beyond cryptocurrency transactions. For example, in
                finance, blockchain networks allow securities trades to be settled in
                minutes rather than days. In supply chains, blockchain networks allow the
                flow of goods and payments to be tracked and logged in real time.</p><p>To determine whether your use case is a good fit for blockchain, ask
                yourself these questions:</p><ol><li>Is a business network involved?</li><li>Is consensus used to validate transactions?</li><li>Is an audit trail, or provenance, required?</li><li>Must the record of transactions be immutable, or tamper proof?</li><li><!--Finality (less disputes)-->Should dispute resolution be
                    final?</li></ol><p>If you answered yes to the first question and to at least one other, then
                your use case would benefit from blockchain technology. A network always
                needs to be involved for blockchain to be the right solution, but the
                network can take many forms. The network can be <em>between
                    organizations</em>, such as a supply chain, or the network can be
                    <em>within an organization</em>. Within an organization, a blockchain
                network could be used to share reference data between divisions or to
                create an audit or compliance network, for example. The network can also
                exist <em>between individuals</em>, who might need to store data, digital
                assets, or contracts on the blockchain, for example.</p><p>See <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/industries/">industry

                transform business networks. We also believe that this innovation has to
                happen in the open, collaborating with other technology companies and
                industries. To this end, IBM continues to contribute code to several
                active Hyperledger projects. </p><p>From IBM's perspective, industrial-grade blockchain technologies have the
                following characteristics:</p><ul><li>A <strong>shared, permissioned ledger</strong> is the append-only
                    system of record (SOR) and single source of truth. It is visible to
                    the authenticated members in the business network channels.</li><li>A <strong>consensus protocol</strong> agreed to by all participating
                    members of the business network ensures that the ledger is updated
                    only with network-verified transactions.</li><li><strong>Cryptography</strong> ensures tamper-proof security,
                    authentication, and integrity of transactions.
                    <!--being recorded in shared ledgerTamper-proof security--></li><!--<li>Privacy with the identity of participants not linked to transactions</li>
                <li>Scalability <!-\-000 ??? with proven IBM record-\-></li>
                <li>Confidentiality with permission control</li>
                <li>Auditability and audit transparency (identity
                    and ownership are proven at any point of the transaction lifecycle)</li>--><li><strong>Chaincode</strong> (also called mart contracts) encapsulates
                    participant terms of agreement for the business that takes place on
                    the network; chaincode is stored on the validating peer nodes in the blockchain.</li></ul><p>In addition to these attributes, enterprise blockchain technology needs to
                meet key industry requirements such as performance, verified identifies,
                and private and confidential transactions. Hyperledger Fabric has been
                architected to meet these needs. It is also designed with a pluggable
                consensus model, allowing businesses to select an optimal algorithm for
                their networks.</p><heading type="h2">How do I get started?</heading><!--<sidebar>
