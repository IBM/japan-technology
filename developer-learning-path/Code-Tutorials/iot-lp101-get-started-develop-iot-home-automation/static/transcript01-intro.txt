Hello. I'm Anna.

Sometimes the most effective home automation systems are the ones that set out to solve really simple problems.

Today I'm building a very simple systems.

It incorporates a few basic sensors, including one that will trigger when someone's at my front door and it can automatically turn on some LED strip lights so I don't have to fumble around in the dark when I get home late at night.

So, follow along as I build this very basic system using a Raspberry Pi and Node-RED.
